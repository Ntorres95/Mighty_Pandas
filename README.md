## Findings

We uncovered dips in dispatched trips towards the spring/summer months (April - July), then steadily increasing toward the fall/winter months (October - January).

We advise to push marketing towards alternate transportation that encourages being outdoors during the summer months for a higher participation rate for bikes/scooters etc.

Surprisingly, wind speed had a significant positive  correlation with dispatched demand.
